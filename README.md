# ðŸŽ‰ prints_charming: The Ultimate Terminal Text Coloring and Styling Solution ðŸŽ‰

![Project Illustration](./images/prints_charming_illustration.png)


## ðŸš€ Introduction

Announcing the third public release of **prints_charming**! Initially created in March of 2023, this Python package has become an indispensable part of my development workflow. It has seen extensive use in 100+ of my own Python modules across various private projects I have been working on over the last eight months. "prints_charming" is more than just another color printing library; it's crafted to elevate your development experience by providing a swift and streamlined way to color and style terminal outputsâ€”be it for standard printing, logging, debugging, or tracingâ€”all without becoming an obstruction in your development process. While the library serves as a robust tool for making terminal outputs more readable, visually appealing, and informative, its true power lies in its versatilityâ€”enhancing the entire terminal and programming experience.

## âœ… Current State

For my current needs, this package does everything I require. It's particularly useful for developers who deal with extensive terminal outputs and need to quickly distinguish between different types of information. It's production-ready and has been rigorously tested in various internal projects.

## ðŸ›  Future Enhancements

Though **prints_charming** is replete with features tailored for Linux terminals, the fairy tale isn't over, and the door is always open for additional community-driven enhancements. While my current commitments across multiple projects may limit my immediate involvement in further development, your contributions could add new chapters to the prints_charming story. 

## ðŸŒŸ Key Features

- **No Dependencies**: Works with the standard Python libraries
- **Efficiency by Design**: With prints_charming, styling your terminal outputs is as simple as adding a keyword argument. Spend less time fiddling with string concatenation and more time writing great code.
- **Text Styling**: Apply foreground and background colors, bold, italic, underlined, and more to your text.
- **Flexible and Customizable**: Use predefined styles or define your own.
- **Variable, Word, Phrase, and substring Styling**: Automatically apply styles to specific variables, words, substrings or phrases in your text.
- **Box/Panel Printing with FormattedTextBox**: Create beautiful Bordered Boxes for sectioning your outputs.
- -**Tablel Printing with TableManager**: Create beautiful Tables inside Boxes or on their own.
- **Intelligent Defaults**: Comes with sensible defaults but allows you to tweak every aspect to your liking.
- **Built for Linux**: This module is developed on Linux for use in Linux terminals, but also supports legacy windows cmd prompt if you set the autoconf_win parameter to True in the init method of PrintsCharming or the WinUtils class, and it supports newer versions of windows os out of the box.
