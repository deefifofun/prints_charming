# ðŸŽ‰ prints_charming: The Ultimate Terminal Text Coloring and Styling Solution ðŸŽ‰

![Project Illustration](./images/prints_charming_illustration.png)
I couldn't get chatGPT to spell Python correctly and include all the other important details lol had to settle for this after accepting it wasn't going to happen after 68 images.

## ðŸš€ Introduction

Announcing the first public release of **prints_charming**! Initially created in March of this year, this Python package has become an indispensable part of my development workflow. It has seen extensive use in 100+ of my own Python modules across various private projects I have been working on over the last eight months. "prints_charming" is more than just another color printing library; it's crafted to elevate your development experience by providing a swift and streamlined way to color and style terminal outputsâ€”be it for standard printing, logging, debugging, or tracingâ€”all without becoming an obstruction in your development process. While the library serves as a robust tool for making terminal outputs more readable, visually appealing, and informative, its true power lies in its versatilityâ€”enhancing the entire terminal and programming experience.

## âœ… Current State

For my current needs, this package does everything I require. It's particularly useful for developers who deal with extensive terminal outputs and need to quickly distinguish between different types of information. It's production-ready and has been rigorously tested in various internal projects.

## ðŸ›  Future Enhancements

Though **prints_charming** is replete with features tailored for Linux terminals, the fairy tale isn't over, and the door is always open for additional community-driven enhancements. While my current commitments across multiple projects may limit my immediate involvement in further development, your contributions could add new chapters to the prints_charming story. For those interested in broadening the library's reach, I welcome contributions that extend support to Windows Command Prompt and PowerShell, as this is currently outside the scope of my planned updates.

## ðŸŒŸ Key Features

- **No Dependencies**: Works with the standard Python libraries
- **Efficiency by Design**: With prints_charming, styling your terminal outputs is as simple as adding a keyword argument. Spend less time fiddling with string concatenation and more time writing great code.
- **Rich Text Styling**: Apply foreground and background colors, bold, italic, underlined, and more to your text.
- **Flexible and Customizable**: Use predefined styles or define your own.
- **Variable, Word, and Phrase Styling**: Automatically apply styles to specific variables, words, or phrases in your text.
- **Header Printing**: Create beautiful headers for sectioning your outputs.
- **Intelligent Defaults**: Comes with sensible defaults but allows you to tweak every aspect to your liking.
- **Built for Linux**: This module is developed and tested on Linux and is intended for use in Linux terminals.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

To get started, install the package and add it to your project.

### Option 1: Using pip

```bash
pip install prints_charming
```

### Option 2: Cloning from GitHub

Alternatively, you can clone the repository directly from GitHub to access the latest features and updates that might not yet be published on PyPI:

1. Open a terminal window.

2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.

3. Run the following command to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/deefifofun/prints_charming.git
```

4. Navigate into the cloned directory:

```bash
cd prints_charming
```

5. Install the package using:

```bash
pip install .
```

This will install the package from the source code.


### Here are examples of pretty much everything:

### Here's a logging example:

```python

import logging
from prints_charming import ColorPrinter
from datetime import datetime
import time

class ColorPrinterLogHandler(logging.Handler):
    TIMESTAMP_FORMAT = '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%f'

    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.cp = ColorPrinter()

    def emit(self, record):
        log_entry = self.format(record)
        self.handle_log_event(log_entry, log_level=record.levelname)

    def handle_log_event(self, text, log_level):
        timestamp = time.time()
        formatted_timestamp = datetime.fromtimestamp(timestamp).strftime(self.TIMESTAMP_FORMAT)

        color = 'blue'  # default color
        if 'ERROR' in log_level.upper():
            color = 'red'
        elif 'WARNING' in log_level.upper():
            color = 'yellow'
        elif 'INFO' in log_level.upper():
            color = 'green'

        timestamped_message = f"LOG[{log_level}]: {formatted_timestamp} {text}"
        self.cp.print(timestamped_message, color=color)

# Set up logging
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

# Add custom handler to the logger
handler = ColorPrinterLogHandler()
logger.addHandler(handler)

# Test logging
logger.info('This is an info message.')
logger.warning('This is a warning message.')
logger.error('This is an error message.')
```

### Here's another logging example for more fine-grained control of individual components:

```python

import logging
from prints_charming import ColorPrinter
from datetime import datetime
import time

class ColorPrinterLogHandler(logging.Handler):
    TIMESTAMP_FORMAT = '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%f'

    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.cp = ColorPrinter()

    def emit(self, record):
        log_entry = self.format(record)
        self.handle_log_event(log_entry, log_level=record.levelname)

    def handle_log_event(self, text, log_level):
        timestamp = time.time()
        formatted_timestamp = datetime.fromtimestamp(timestamp).strftime(self.TIMESTAMP_FORMAT)

        # Define styles for different components
        timestamp_style = 'gray'  # Change as needed
        level_styles = {
            'INFO': 'green',
            'WARNING': 'yellow',
            'ERROR': 'red',
            'DEBUG': 'blue',
            'CRITICAL': 'vred'
        }

        log_level_style = level_styles.get(log_level, 'default')

        # Get styled components
        styled_timestamp = self.cp.apply_style(timestamp_style, f"LOG[{log_level}]")
        styled_level = self.cp.apply_style(log_level_style, log_level)
        styled_text = self.cp.apply_style(log_level_style, text)

        # Create the final styled message
        timestamped_message = f"{styled_timestamp}: {formatted_timestamp} {styled_level} - {styled_text}"
        
        
        print(timestamped_message)


# Initialize logging
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

# Create an instance of your custom logging handler
handler = ColorPrinterLogHandler()

# Add the custom handler to the logger
logger.addHandler(handler)

# Test out different log levels
logger.debug("This is a debug message.")
logger.info("This is an info message.")
logger.warning("This is a warning message.")
logger.error("This is an error message.")
logger.critical("This is a critical message.")
```
